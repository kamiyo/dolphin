// Creates kaiser-windowed ideal lowpass filter
// Generates and stores only one side of the impulse response as it is symmetrical.
// Thus, when performing convolution, first apply the filter as is stored to samples
// before current time, and then to samples after.
//
// Quality of filter = sharpness of rolloff + attenuation of stopband
//
// num_crossings: affects transition-band-width, the sharper the rolloff, the more taps needed.
//				also slightly affects stopband ripple magnitude. Quality divisions are subjective.
//        For example, on the digital audio workstation software Reaper, "Fast" is 17, "Medium"
//        is 65, "Good" is 193 (suitable for rendering), and "HQ" is 513. The following table
//        seems more reasonable in the context of the emulator
//
//				Quality:
//				   low:    < 17
//				   medium: between 17 and 35
//				   high:   > 35
//
// samples_per_crossing: affects the accuracy of the filter response; this is dependent
//                       on the bit-length of each filter sample. Since we are also storing
//                       deltas between filter samples, samples_per_crossing
//                       should be around 2 ^ (sample_bit_length / 2). In this case,
//                       since float = 32bit, the minimum is 512.
//                       Refer to ccrma.standford.edu/~jos/resample/ for analysis
//
// beta: parameter for Kaiser window (tradeoff between main-lobe width and side-lobes levels).
//       This affects the stopband ripple attenuation: 8.0 = about 70db attenuation
//
// CCRMA uses 27 taps x 512 samples for high quality.
//
// cutoff_cycle: the center of the transition band (in terms of nyquist = samplerate/2);
//               1.0 gives center of nyquist freq.
